Code to reproduce result from my paper

Place all the R scripts and the data folder under the same directory whenever codes are executed. The codes are designed for test purpose only so please run the code line by line in Rstudio to avoid any potential mistake. 

I run the codes on my Macbook Pro M1 so that the function "mclapply" for parallel computing might not run properly on Windows or Linux machine. Feel free to contact me jiajie.kong@berkeley.edu if you have any question.
